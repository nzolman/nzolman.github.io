As an undergrad at Caltech, my attention was focused primarily on mathematical physics and how we can use ideas from topology and geometry to understand our universe (e.g. unifying the Standard Model). However, after graduating in 2016, I---like many other physicists---started to become interested in machine learning. Since 2018, I've been working as a data scientist in the aerospace industry. While my work these past years has primarily focused on using deep reinforcement learning for autonomous systems, I have developed a passion for physics-informed machine learning (PIML) and dynamics extraction and discovery. I seek to unify and advance techniques from math, physics, and machine learning to engineering and the applied sciences.
