Math 134: UCLA's upper division course introducing applied dynamical systems theory. The course followed Strogatz's [text](https://www.amazon.com/Nonlinear-Dynamics-Student-Solutions-Manual/dp/0813349109/ref=asc_df_0813349109/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=312168166316&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=6067369921109087119&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9061109&hvtargid=pla-455692727025&psc=1), covering the basics of nonlinear dynamics theory and bifurcations.
