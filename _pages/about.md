***Note***: This website is a work in progress; please excuse any strangeness that might seem out of place! 

I am a current PhD student at the Universtiy of Washington (co-advised by <a href="https://www.eigensteve.com/">Steve Brunton</a> and <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/">Nathan Kutz</a>) studying the intersection of dynamical systems and machine learning. My reserach interests lie primarily in incorporating/exploiting known physical knowledge (or more generally mathematical structures) of physical systems to improve our ability to solve machine learning and optimization tasks. (I also have interests in pure mathematics/theoretical physics and in a past life I studied them, too---you can find those papers floating around here, too). 

Outside of academics, you can find me playing tennis, attempting to write/play music, and searching for the best breakfast burrito the Pacific Northwest has to offer.
